 * All dwg drawing entities that need to compute

 * this interface.
 * 
 * This "extrusion" transforms coordinates from the 
 * "Object Coordinate System" (OCS) to the
 * "World Coordinate System" (WCS).
 * 
 *  For some entities, the OCS is equivalent to the 
 *  WCS and all points are expressed in World coordinates. 

		Entities 						Notes

		3D entities such as 			These entities do not lie in a 
		line, point, 3dface,			particular plane. All points are  
		3D polyline,					expressed in world coordinates.  
		3D vertex, 3D mesh, 			Of these entities, only lines and points can be extruded. 
		3D mesh vertex
	



		2D entities such as circle, arc, 		These entities are planar in nature. 
		solid, trace, text, attrib, attdef, 	All points are expressed in object coordinates. 
		shape, insert, 2D polyline, 2D vertex, 	All of these entities can be extruded.
